We would like to thank the referee for reviewing the paper, and for the excellent
suggestions.  We address each in turn below:

Thanks for this suggestion.  We have moved much of the math from sections 3 and
4 to three appendices.  This shortened the main body of the paper by about 3 pages.

Thanks, we have added extra discussion of this to the introduction.

Thanks, we added this reference and an extra sentence to clarify this aspect
of symplectic integration.

Thanks.  Eric Agol was a co-author on that paper, and so we did consider
adding similar 'proofs' to each of the equations.  Although we have not implemented
this suggestion, we note that we do have unit tests in the github repository which
check that the code is working properly.  These may be found here:

https://github.com/ericagol/NbodyGradient.jl/tree/master/test

and the tests are called each time a build is generated via continuous integration
with this script:

https://github.com/ericagol/NbodyGradient.jl/blob/master/test/runtests.jl

However, this does not guarantee that the equations in the manuscript do not contain 
typos, which was the main purpose of the unit tests for equations.

> Minor comments:
> - Page 3, first line of right column, "V is the total kinetic energy" -> "potential energy"

  Thanks for catching this  - we made this change.

> - Beginning of section 2: "the advantage of this approach" -> "the advantage of this approach relative to [WH method]"

  This change has been made, and earlier we add the abbereviation "WH" when we first cite Wisdom & Holman (1991). 

> - Section 2, second to last paragraph seems out of place here. Perhaps this could be moved to the end of the section?

  Done.

> - I spent some time puzzling over figure 1. Could the bottom-right-most line (beginning with -T_ij(deltax_kd# be repositioned so that it's clearer which part of the diagram that line is associated with? 

  Thanks. This figure had a typo in it, which we have fixed, and we have now moved the bottom-most-right
  line to (hopefully) help clarify the figure.

In addition to these suggested changes, we have made some additional
changes to the paper:

1).  We fixed algorithm 2, which had some errors.
2).  We changed Figure 7 to include comparison with a symplectic algorithm
(WHFAST), also a part of REBOUND.
3).
