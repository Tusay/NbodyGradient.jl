# NbodyGradient
A differentiable N-body integrator for modeling transiting exoplanets, and more.

## Getting Started
The code is currently under developement, but the main branch is kept stable. The best way to use the code is to run the following in the REPL
```julia
]add https://github.com/ericagol/NbodyGradient
```
Then use like any other Julia package
```julia
using NbodyGradient
```

See the [Examples](@ref) page for basic usage.
